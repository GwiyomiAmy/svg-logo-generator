   ## Tests

   Tests can be found in the shapes.test.js file. These tests make sure that there is a limit to how many letters one can type in for their logo svg file. If you also wish to run tests, you can open the shapes.test.js file and within the test for each shape, locate the text "AAAA" and replace it with your desired test logo text (don't forget to save the file). In the terminal, simply type "npm test", and let the terminal do the rest.
